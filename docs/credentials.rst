Supplying Credentials
---------------------

.. note:: Amaxa configuration files are versioned and are validated at runtime. This documentation is for the current version of the credential file, version 2. Upgrade existing projects with version 1 files to make use of new features.

Credentials are supplied in a YAML or JSON file, with several options available dependening upon how you'd like to authenticate.

SFDX
****

Amaxa can directly use SFDX authentication.

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: 2
    credentials:
        sfdx: org-name

You can supply an org's alias or username. Amaxa will obtain access details from SFDX.

Username and Password
*********************

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: 2
    credentials:
        username:
            username: 'test@example.com'
            password: 'blah'
            security-token: '00000'
            organization-id '00D000000000001'  # This value is optional.
            sandbox: True

JWT Authentication
******************

Amaxa also allows JWT authentication, for fully headless operation:

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: 2
    credentials:
        jwt:
            username: 'test@example.com'
            consumer-key: 'GOES_HERE'
            key: |
            -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
            <snipped>
            -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
            keyfile: server.key

If your JWT key is stored externally in a file, use the key ``keyfile`` with the name of that file rather than including the key inline.

Token Authentication
********************

Lastly, if you establish authentication outside Amaxa (with Salesforce DX, for example), you can directly provide an access token and instance URL.

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: 2
    credentials:
        token:
            access-token: '.....'
            instance-url: 'https://test.salesforce.com'

Sourcing Credentials from Environment Variables
***********************************************

Amaxa can draw any credential parameter other than the type of authentication (``username``, ``jwt``, or ``token``) from a user-specified environment variable. Specify this by including a dict with the key ``env`` instead of a literal value for the relevant key. ``env`` entries and literals can be mixed in any combination. For JWT authentication, for example, specify

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: 2
    credentials:
        jwt:
            username:
                env: USERNAME
            consumer-key:
                env: CONSUMER_KEY
            keyfile: server.key

Given this credential file, Amaxa will take its JWT keyfile from ``server.key``, and derive the required user name and consumer key from the environment variables ``USERNAME`` and ``CONSUMER_KEY``.
